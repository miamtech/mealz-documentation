# Notifications

Mealz provides a notification service to make your UI more interactive for customers.
Currently we handle two events :

- **Recipe added to cart**
- **Recipe liked**

<Toaster />

:::info
By default, notifications are disabled.
You must provide content for the events you wish to enable for this to work.
