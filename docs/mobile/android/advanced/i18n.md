# Internationalisation - I18n

This section is about how we can define localised content in the context of the Mealz SDK.

By default, Mealz supports two languages: English and French

## Override Mealz SDK values

### Strings

Let's assume that the Mealz SDK embeds the following localisation string:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_miam_i18n_recipe_add">Add ingredients</string>
</resources>
```

On Android, it is fairly simple to override resources that come from our library. 
Just declare values with the same identifier, and it's done.

In your application, just add the following string declaration inside a `res/values(-LANG)/<FILENAME>.xml` (the filename doesn't matter) to override it:

```xml
<resources>
    <string name="com_miam_i18n_recipe_add">Add recipe to basket</string>
</resources>
```

### Plurals

Let's assume that the Mealz SDK embed the following localisation string:

```xml
<resources>
    <plural name="com_miam_basket_product">
        <item quantity="one">%d article</item>
        <item quantity="other">%d articles</item>
    </plural>
</resources>
```

On Android, it is fairly simple to override resources that come from our library.
Just declare values with the same identifier, and it's done.

In your application, just add the following plural declaration inside a `res/values(-LANG)/<FILENAME>.xml` (the filename doesn't matter) to override it:

```xml
<resources>
    <plural name="com_miam_basket_product">
        <item quantity="one">%d item</item>
        <item quantity="other">%d items</item>
    </plural>
</resources>
```

When consuming `com_miam_i18n_recipe_add`, you should see **Add recipe to basket** instead of **Add ingredients**.   
When consuming `com_miam_basket_product`, you should see **1 item** & **2 items** instead of **1 article** & **2 articles**.
