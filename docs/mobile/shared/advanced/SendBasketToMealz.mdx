Mealz listens & subscribes to the retailer basket.
However, sometimes events occur that Mealz does not hear & the sync is not complete.
For example, starting the app anew or resetting the basket can potentially damage the sync process.
To facilitate the connection between the Mealz Basket & the retailer basket, we have a function `SendBasketToMealz`.

This function accepts the retailer products as a list & will instantly update the list of products that Mealz stores locally.

<SendBasketToMealz platform= {props.platform}/>
