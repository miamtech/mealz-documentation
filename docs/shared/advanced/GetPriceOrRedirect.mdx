For Mealz to work properly, a store is mandatory.
Without a store, we cannot generate a Recipe price, see the products, or purchase anything.

However, we provide a method that can fetch a price of a recipe, & if the store is not selected yet, redirect to the Store Selector.
This is ideal when you have your own external Recipes that are not generated by Mealz (yet shared with us).

<GetPriceOrRedirect platform= {props.platform}/>
