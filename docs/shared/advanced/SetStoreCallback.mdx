For Mealz to work properly, a store is mandatory.
Without a store, we cannot generate a Recipe price, see the products, or purchase anything.

However, Recipe Cards, & our catalog, CAN be shown without a store.
When the user clicks on a Recipe Card, we prompt the user to select a store.
You must pass in a function for us to navigate to your Store Selector.

:::info
Using Mealz without an active store is only available in version 4.1 and above
:::

<SetStoreRedirectionConfig platform= {props.platform}/>
