# Introduction

This SDK aims to facilitate the integration of Mealz eCommerce to any grocery shopping mobile application or any 3rd party app that connects to multiple retailers.

It implements a series of components that can be re-styled to your standards, and injected into your app.
Mealz Components interact with each other and handle the communication with the Mealz API.
Using this SDK, you should not need to communicate with the Mealz API directly from your app.

## Background knowledge

### How do we get the data?

Your backend will work with our backend to share the referential information, often just called the "referential."
In the case of a 3rd party app, we will work with the grocery retailers to get their referential.
Our backend team will update the referential (fetch the data) somewhere between every hour or once a day (this will be decided commercially).
We will get access to every product, & the corresponding price, at each & every store that Mealz is enabled at.

### I am a retailer (grocery store), how does the communication with Mealz work?

For the sake of the example, we will pretend that Mealz is integrated with the grocery chain SupaMRKT.

As a retailer, SupaMRKT has a "basket" for their product.
Mealz will also keep a basket of products.
SupaMRKT will listen to the Mealz basket & our SDK will listen & update the SupaMRKT basket.
- If a user adds a Mealz Product -> it will be pushed to the SupaMRKT basket
- If a user removes a Mealz Product -> it will be removed from the SupaMRKT basket
- If a user adds a SupaMRKT product -> Mealz will do nothing
- If a user removes a SupaMRKT product -> Mealz will cross-reference its products & remove it if it was also a Mealz product.

Mealz keeps a copy of the SupaMRKT basket & updates it every time there is a change to the real one.
When there is a change involving Mealz products, Mealz will send the CHANGE between the two baskets, & the SupaMRKT will update their basket accordingly.

For example,

SupaMRKT has this basket:
- Tomatoes, 2
- Granola, 1
- Yoghurt, 1
- Banana, 3

Mealz has this basket:
- Granola, 1
- Yoghurt, 1
- Banana, 3

As you can see, the user added Tomatoes individually, or OUTSIDE a Mealz Recipe.
It can be assumed that the Granola, Yoghurt, & Banana were added WITH a Mealz Recipe (Yoghurt Parfait perhaps).

Now, lets see an example of a user adding a Mealz product.
This user loves Granola, so they decided to add another Granola item to their basket.

Their Mealz basket is now this:
- Granola, 2
- Yoghurt, 1
- Banana, 3

The change sent to SupaMRKT will be this:
[Granola, 2]

SupaMRKT will now update their basket, replacing the existing Granola of 1 item with the Granola with 2 items.

Likewise, if a user added Strawberries to their basket, via Mealz, their Mealz Basket would look like this:
- Granola, 2
- Yoghurt, 1
- Banana, 3
- Strawberries, 1

The change sent to SupaMRKT will be this:
[Strawberries, 1]

At the end of the transaction, the SupaMRKT basket would be this:
- Tomatoes, 2
- Granola, 2
- Yoghurt, 1
- Banana, 3
- Strawberries, 1

Of course, your Product objects (& ours) are more complex than just the name & quantity, but in essence this is what occurs under the hood.

### I am a Recipe Provider (3rd party connecting to a grocery store, like a delivery app), how does the communication with Mealz work?

This case is much easier.
For the sake of example, our client will be Deliver-Nous Groceries, a delivery service for produce.

Mealz will maintain the basket for both parties.
Deliver-Nous Groceries does not need a basket.

When it is time to check out, we will send the basket to the 3rd party grocery store, such as SupaMRKT, to handle payment.

### Get up & running

The integration of the SDK into your app will take three steps:

1. **Initialization**: Define the few mapping functions the SDK needs to interact with your app (
push products to basket, retrieve the user unique id...)
2. **Components injection**: Fill your app with Mealz components wherever relevant (recipe cards in
search results grids, recipes catalog on a dedicated page...)
3. **Styling**: Apply your own stylesheets, globally at the SDK level, and specifically for each
component

### Project architecture

This SDK is leveraging Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile so most of the Models, Controllers, and
Services (interactions with Mealz API) can be implemented only once and reused both in iOS and
Android apps. Only the Views have to be implemented separately for each platform.
