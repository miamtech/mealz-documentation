First to init Mealz we need your application context and also your provider key

## Store setup

For Mealz to work properly, your user must be connected to a specific store so we can accurately provide recipes with available ingredients.
To add the store that the user is currently at, you can use this code:

<StoreSetup platform ={props.platform}/>
