# User customisation

Mealz can provide a personalized experience for customers. 
To achieve this we propose two solutions:

- Preferences: Locally stored _Actionable without customer consent by the retailer_
- Profiling : Back hosted tastes _Can be disabled by the customer_

:::note
These two solutions are GDPR-compliant
:::

## Preferences

Our preferences feature uses the native IOS local storage for persistence.

 ```swift
import MealziOSSDK
import MealzUIiOSSDK

// inside MealzViewConfig
static let catalogConfig = CatalogFeatureConstructor(
   usesPreferences: true, // set this to true

// when creating Feature
// feature = MealzCatalogFeatureSwiftUI( // <--- for SwiftUI
feature = MealzCatalogFeatureUIKit(
    catalogFeatureConstructor: MealzViewConfig.catalogConfig, // <--- this is what we add
)
```

## Profiling

Mealz offers your customers a fully personalized experience based on their tastes.
Our AI will learn from the customer's choices and suggest more and more specific recipes and
product.

This feature can be disabled by the customer if they wish.

To do this, we expose this function:

```swift 
// file MealzManager.swift
import mealzcore

public class MealzManager {
    // allow profiling -> can we use your personal data to provide custom recipes?
    Mealz.shared.user.setProfilingAllowance(allowance: true)
}
```

## Like recipe

You can disable the Like feature as well

```swift 
// file MealzManager.swift
import mealzcore

public class MealzManager {
    // allow users to heart recipes
    Mealz.shared.user.setEnableLike(isEnable: true)
}
```

:::note
The like feature will be set to TRUE by default
