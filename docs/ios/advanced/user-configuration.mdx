# User customisation

Mealz can provide a personalized experience for customers. 
To achieve this we propose two solutions:

- Preferences: Locally stored _Actionable without customer consent by the retailer_
- Profiling : Back hosted tastes _Can be disabled by the customer_

:::note
These two solutions are GDPR-compliant
:::

## Preferences

Our preferences feature uses the native IOS local storage for persistence.

Example with **SwiftUI** :

 ```swift
import MiamIOSFramework
import MiamNeutraliOSFramework

struct CatalogTabView: View {
    var body: some View {
        CatalogView(
            params: localCatalogViewParams(navigationController: self.navigationController),
            catalogPackageRowParams: localCatalogPackageRowParams(navigationController: self.navigationController),
            usesPreferences: Bool = true, // set this to true
            gridConfig: localRecipesListViewConfig
        )
    }
}
```

## Profiling

Mealz offers to your customer a fully personalized experience based on their tastes.
Our AI will learn from the customer's choices and suggest more and more specific recipes and
product.

This feature can be disabled by the customer if they wish.

To do this, we expose this function:

```swift 
// file MealzManager.swift
import miamCore

public class MealzManager {
    // allow profiling -> can we use your personal data to provide custom recipes?
    Mealz.shared.user.setProfilingAllowance(allowance: true)
}
```

## Like recipe

You can disable the Like feature as well

```swift 
// file MealzManager.swift
import miamCore

public class MealzManager {
    // allow users to heart recipes
    Mealz.shared.user.setEnableLike(isEnable: true)
}
```

:::note
The like feature will be set to TRUE by default
