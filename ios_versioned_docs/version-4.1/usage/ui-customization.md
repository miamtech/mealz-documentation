# Custom UI Components

Each page is customizable, especially the background, loader, & empty state.
For the default Mealz background & empty, it is just a clear white background.
For the default Loader, it just a blue progress loader.

Customizing components is easy, all you need to is pass your custom components, that implement the protocol, to the `viewOptions` parameter.
