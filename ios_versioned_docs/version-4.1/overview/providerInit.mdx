## Provider minimum requirement

You provide recipes and use Mealz to push it to a retailer. For example, a food delivery service that works with multiple grocery stores. 

## ProviderKey - base64 key to set information

<IosProviderId />

:::tip
Your keys will be provided by our Development team
:::

## Basic implementation

There are several options to configure to handle authless users. The below is a basic implementation
where the Mealz initialization process will only start after the user is **logged in** and has **selected a valid store**.

First, to init Mealz we need your application context and your provider key

:::note
Two keys will have been sent to you: one for **development** and one for **production**.
:::

<IosBasicImpProvider />

## User setup

Here is how to pass the user ID to the SDK, directly within the host app:

:::info
You can also enable our **authless** feature, more information [**here**](../advanced/user-configuration/##AuthLess
).
:::

<IosUserSetting />

:::info
To get full list of user features check [**User configurations**](../advanced/user-configuration).
:::

## Store setup

For Mealz to work properly, your user must be connected to a specific store so we can accurately provide recipes with available ingredients.
To add the store that the user is currently at, you can use this code:

<IosStoreSetup />

:::info
You can also set a callback to redirect to your Store Selector, more information [**here**](../advanced/store-configuration/##SetStore
).

Congratulations, **Mealz** is good to go ðŸ¥³
