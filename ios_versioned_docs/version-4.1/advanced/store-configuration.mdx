# Store Configuration

## Set Price Book

To set the price book, you can use this code:
```kotlin
import mealzcore

Mealz.shared.basket.setPriceBook(priceBookId: pricebook.rawValue)
```

## Set Store

For Mealz to work properly, a store is mandatory.
Without a store, we cannot generate a Recipe price, see the products, or purchase anything.

However, Recipe Cards, & our catalog, CAN be shown without a store.
When the user clicks on a Recipe Card, we prompt the user to select a store.
You must pass in a function for us to navigate to your Store Selector.
