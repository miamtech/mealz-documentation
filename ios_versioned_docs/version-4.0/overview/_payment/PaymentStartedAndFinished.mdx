There are two functions that need to be called during the checkout experience.
Mealz does not collect payment, but we must reset our basket & lodge the transaction to share with your commerical team.
Checkout is a crucial part of the Mealz experience.

### Payment Started


When your use selects "Buy now", or when the payment tunnel is begun, you must call `paymentStarted.`

<IosBasketService.PaymentStarted/>

This will save the payment information on our end & allow us to cross reference with your team for every transaction Mealz is involved with.
Internally, we do NOT track payments where the value of products added by Mealz is 0, so you do not need to implement this logic.

### Payment Finished

When your payment tunnel is over, & you've returned a "Payment Success", you must call `paymentFinished.`

:::danger
It is of crucial importance that you call this function BEFORE clearing your basket and pass the correct values for the totalAmount & totalProductCount.
Please ensure these are the values of the transaction, NOT the values after the transaction (probably an empty basket).
If you clear your basket, then call this method, all products will be considered as deleted so the ratio of products added by Mealz will not be correct.
