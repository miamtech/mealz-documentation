# Introduction

Mealz Custom Elements is a library
of [Server Side Rendered (SSR)](https://www.heavy.ai/technical-glossary/server-side-rendering) [Web Components](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_components)
designed to enhance the customer experience in drive stores.

To utilize these components, we provide access to a [NestJS](https://docs.nestjs.com/techniques/mvc) API. The API
features endpoints named after the components, facilitating easy retrieval and integration.

These SSR components interact with a specialized Lit library for hydration and CSS application, ensuring smooth,
dynamic, and visually appealing content rendering.
