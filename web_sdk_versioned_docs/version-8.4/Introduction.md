## Introduction

NgMiam SDK is an open-source library letting you enhance your customer experience using **[Mealz](https://mealz.ai/)**'s technology.

In order to be able to let you use its capabilities regardless of your Javascript framework, we've designed it as a WebComponents library that you can inject anywhere.

Two builds are available :

- **[webc-miam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webc-miam)** - built as a WebComponents library
- **[ng-miam](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ng-miam)** - built as an Angular lib

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 10.2.3.
