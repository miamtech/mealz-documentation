# Enable order history

Our library provides the functionality to enable order history, allowing users to easily track their past orders directly within the catalog. This feature introduces a newly redesigned "My Space" section, which includes two dedicated tabs: **Favorites** and **History**.

## Activating Order History

1. To begin, please contact our team to receive the required token for enabling order history functionality.

2. Replace your existing `mealzToken` with the new token and configure the user's language settings. Use the following code snippet:

  ```js
    window.mealz.supplier.setupWithToken('newMealzToken');
    window.mealz.user.setLanguage('en');
  ```

## Feature updates 

Once order history is enabled, the following updates will be applied:

The "Favorites" page in the catalog will be renamed to "My Space", featuring two tabs:
- **Favorites Tab**: Displays the list of recipes saved as favorites by a connected user

Clicking on an order in the History tab opens a drawer providing informations about the recipes included in the selected order.

You can further customize the appearance of the order history components to match your websiteâ€™s design.
