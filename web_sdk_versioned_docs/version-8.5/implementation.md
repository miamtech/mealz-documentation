# Implementation

## Implementing Mealz features into your website

The integration of the SDK in your app can be done in 4 steps :

1. Executing the script on your website so the WebComponents are available
2. Setup : Our library is designed to be as generic as it can, so this is where you will tell the library who you are so the services are initialised based on your retailer, with your products and your recipes. This is also were you will start a key process - the synchronization of our baskets.
3. Add the tags for the WebComponents into your code
4. Customize the styling of those components to match your site's design

You already know how to do step 1. and step 3. and 4. shouldn't be too much of a problem, so the main thing you need to know is about how to do the setup step. This is what the next few parts will be about !
