If you don't want to use the provided Mealz navigation, you can recreate the navigation yourself.
We have documented a simple walkthrough, but feel free to implement your practice of Coordinators.

## Steps

### 1. Create Standalone page
<CreateFavoritesPage />

### 2. Add LikeButton to your components
<AddLikeButton />
