# Notifications

Mealz provides a notification service to make your UI more interactive for customers.
Currently we handle two events : 

  - **Recipe added to cart**
  - **Recipe liked**

<Toaster />

:::info
By default, notifications are disabled. 
You must provide content for the events you wish to enable for this to work.

# Analytics

To follow along to our analytics events, you can call:
<Analytics />
