Each page & template is fully customizable to your brand's design.
All View Options are optional, there are Mealz defaults for each view.

:::info
To understand how to create a custom component, you can read [here](../../../usage/ui-customization).
:::

We recommend putting all of your custom ViewOptions into a custom class.
In our sample implementations, we have one class `MealzViewConfig`, however you may find it more maintainable to have multiple classes.

```swift
import MealziOSSDK
import MealzUIiOSSDK
import MealzNaviOSSDK

struct MealzViewConfig {
// the below View Options go here
}
```
