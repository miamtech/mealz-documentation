# User customisation

Mealz can provide a personalized experience for customers.
To achieve this we propose two solutions:

- Preferences: Locally stored _Actionable without customer consent by the retailer_
- Profiling : Back hosted tastes _Can be disabled by the customer_

:::note
These two solutions are GDPR-compliant
:::

## Preferences

The preferences uses the native Android preference to make them persistent. 
To enable this feature you need to provide a **context** and change the Mealz preference's configuration flag to `true`:

Example with **Jetpack Compose** :

```kotlin
import ai.mealz.core.Mealz

class MainActivity : ComponentActivity() {
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)
        setContent {
            Column {
                // EnablePreference show preference button on Catalog
                Catalog(this@MainActivity).apply { enablePreference(true) }.Content()
            }
        }
    }
}
 ```

## Profiling

Mealz offers to your customer a fully personalized experience based on their tastes.
Our AI will learn from the customer's choices and suggest more and more specific recipes and
product.

This feature can be disabled by the customer if they wish.

To do this, we expose this function:

```kotlin 
// file MealzManager.kt
import ai.mealz.core.Mealz

class MealzManager(val appContext: Context) {    
    // allow profiling -> can we use your personal data to provide custom recipes?
    Mealz.user.setProfilingAllowance(allowance: true)
}
```

## Like recipe

You can disable the Like feature as well

```kotlin 
// file MealzManager.kt
import ai.mealz.core.Mealz

class MealzManager(val appContext: Context) {    
    // allow users to heart recipes
    Mealz.user.setEnableLike(isEnable: true)
}
```

:::note
The like feature will be set to TRUE by default
:::

## AuthLess

AuthLess mode allows Mealz to create an anonymous user and to find previous lists of non-connected users.
Once the user connects to your app Mealz will merge anonymous user into the connected user.

You can enable AuthLess feature in mealz initialisation

<AndroidAuthlessConfig />

:::info
**isAnonymousModeEnabled** is defaulted to **false**
:::

You can also provide Mealz a redirection function to your login page. We will use this function when connecting the user connection becomes mandatory, like adding the products to the basket. Even without supporting anonymous users, we can display Mealz Recipes on your apps, with CTAs requiring a user sign in. 

 <AndroidLoginRedirectionConfig />

:::warning
 if **isAnonymousModeEnabled** is set to **true** Mealz will **never** call your redirection function
:::

## Get Price Or Redirect

For Mealz to work properly, a store is mandatory.
Without a store, we cannot generate a Recipe price, see the products, or purchase anything.

However, we provide a method that can fetch a price of a recipe, & if the store is not selected yet, redirect to the Store Selector.
This is ideal when you have your own external Recipes that are not generated by Mealz (yet shared with us).

<AndroidGetPriceOrRedirect />
