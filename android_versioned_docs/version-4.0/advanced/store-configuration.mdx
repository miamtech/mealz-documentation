# Store Configuration

## Set Price Book

To set the price book, you can use this code:
```kotlin
import ai.mealz.core.Mealz

Mealz.basket.setPriceBook(priceBookId: pricebook.rawValue)
```

## Set Store

For Mealz to work properly, a store is mandatory.
Without a store, we cannot generate a Recipe price, see the products, or purchase anything.
